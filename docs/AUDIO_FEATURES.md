- **Real-time transcription**: Users can speak into their microphone and see their words appear in real-time
- **Continuous recording**: Supports long-form speech with automatic transcription
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indicators show when recording is active and when transcription is processing
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallbacks when speech recognition is not supported

### 2. Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)
- **Assistant response playback**: AI responses can be read aloud automatically
- **Manual playback control**: Users can play/pause audio for any assistant message
- **Audio settings**: Global toggle to enable/disable audio output
